IEEE 2024 Paper – "Characterization of Short-circuit Faults…”

Why are the batteries connected in parallel?
So they all share the same voltage but can supply different currents.

If one battery fails, others can still support the load.

Objective: Simulate disconnection of one battery and monitor SOC freeze.

Simulation Details: Used Breaker block controlled by Step signal; SOC of Battery2 froze, others took over.

What It Proves: Disconnected batteries freeze SOC; others compensate, causing imbalance.
